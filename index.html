  <h1>Hi there, I'm Patrick Barth!</h1>
  <p><img src="img/profilepic.png" alt="profile" height="36px" width="36px"/></p>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in Astronomy and Geology at the University of St Andrews 
		and part of the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/exoplanets/">Centre for Exoplanet Science</a>. 
		I'm working on the effect of lighting on the atmospheric chemistry of Earth and other planets and 
		investigating its impact on the origin of life. 
		This includes Miller-Urey like sparking experiments and simulations of chemical processes in 
		planetary atmospheres.</p>
